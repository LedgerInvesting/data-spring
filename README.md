## D3 in react + spring animations
When adding data visualizations to a react app [data-ui](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui) is an excellent option to consider, providing much of the power of D3 within the easy to use React/JSX API. When comparing the options for using spring animations in a React app, [react-spring](https://blog.usejournal.com/why-react-needed-yet-another-animation-library-introducing-react-spring-8212e424c5ce) stands out as the hands down strongest choice.
